## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-21

Initial playable build — the full v1 scope in one pass.

### Added
- **PWA scaffold:** `manifest.json` (standalone display, theme colors), `sw.js`
  service worker (cache-first offline shell), generated home-screen icons
  (180/192/512 + maskable), iOS `apple-touch-icon` and standalone meta.
- **Board & rendering:** 6×6 DOM grid, HUD (score / best / coins), next-piece
  and storehouse slots, store row, game-over overlay, merge "pop" animation.
  Tiles drawn from a swappable emoji asset map.
- **Match engine:** flood-fill detection of connected same-type groups and
  cascading merges. Full build chain grass → … → triple castle, with the
  Floating Castle → Triple Castle merge requiring four (not three).
- **Bears:** spawn on a chance that ramps with turns, shuffle one tile per
  placement, and turn into tombstones when trapped. Tombstone chain
  (tombstone → church → cathedral → treasury).
- **Storehouse:** reserve slot; tap to swap the held piece (empty slot stashes
  and draws a fresh piece).
- **Store + coins:** earn coins from merges, buy build-chain tiles at prices
  that rise with each purchase. In-game pretend coins only.
- **Scoring & game over:** per-tier placement/merge points, best-score tracking,
  game over when the board fills.
- **Persistence:** full game state saved to `localStorage` after every action;
  restored on load. Best score persisted separately.
- **Docs:** `README.md` (run/install/structure/tuning) and this changelog.

### Notes
- Scoring, spawn weights, and bear-chance ramp are starting values in
  `js/config.js`, meant to be tuned by feel.
- Verified: 10/10 pure-logic tests (merges, 4-castle rule, cascade, tombstone
  chain) plus in-browser play-through of placement, cascade, storehouse, store
  purchase, and reload-persistence.
